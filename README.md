# What is this?
_Maybe.py_ is a software that i have created for testing server from an attack called DOS attack.

# Setup
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/iwansal64/maybe-py.git
$ cd maybe-py
$ chmod +x install
$ install
$ maybe
```
One line installation (just Copy and Paste):
```
git clone https://github.com/iwansal64/maybe-py.git && cd maybe-py && chmod +x install && install && maybe
```
and that's pretty much it..
Now your computer should can run the program now by typing `maybe`
